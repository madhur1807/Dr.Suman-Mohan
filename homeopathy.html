					Homeopathy is legally practiced in over 80 countries. Being the second largest system of medicine in the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO), homeopathy has grown by 25-30% over allopathy in the last 5 years. 
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>Homeopathy is Safe</b></h4>		
				<ul>
					<li>So widespread are drug-induced diseases that the medical system even had to coin a term for them - iatrogenic disorders.</li>
					<li>In 2009, more deaths were caused by pharma drugs than traffic accidents, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li>
					<li>L.A. Times review of coroners’ records find that there are more deaths due to prescribed drugs than there are to heroine & cocaine together.</li>
					<li>Homeopathy is safe and treats holistically with practically no side-effects.</li>
				</ul>
			    <br>

				<h4><b>Homeopathy is Sure</b></h4>		
				<p>The outcome of homeopathic treatment i.e. the improvement in the condition of the patient, can be measured with advanced technologies.</p>

				<p>Positive Treatment Outcome with Dr Batra’s™ Homeopathy - authenticated by American Quality Assessors:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>96.6% positive treatment outcome in treating Hair Loss</li>
					<li>95.9% positive treatment outcome in treating Obesity</li>
					<li>96% positive treatment outcome in treating Women's Health Problems</li>
					<li>94.3% positive treatment outcome in treating Skin Disorders</li>
				</ul>	
				<br>

				<h4><b>Homeopathy is Scientific</b></h4>		
				<p>Over 600 published research studies and over 300 trials in homeopathy have been conducted proving its efficacy in treating medical disorders. A few are summarised below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A pre-clinical study on ‘Pharmacological evaluation of homeopathic medicines’ conducted at Central Drug Research Institute (Lucknow, India) suggests that homeopathic medicine Lycopodium 30C has showed its benefits on high blood pressure, cardiovascular ailments, poor memory and inflammation and provides over 60% protection against alcohol-induced gastric ulcer.</li>
					<li>82.6% of people treated with homeopathy experienced good relief from allergic symptoms as compared to 67.3% of people who experienced relief from conventional medicine according to Homeopathy and Conventional Medicine: An Outcomes Study Comparing Effectiveness in a Primary Care Setting (J Altern Complement Med 2001).</li>
					<li>A study of 118 patients suffering from eczema published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine reported that homeopathy is as effective as conventional treatments in the short term and more effective in the long run.</li>
					<li>According to Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy published by Clinical Research Unit (Homeopathy) Puducherry, homeopathic remedy Rhustox 200 has been found to provide relief from pain and stiffness in joints due to rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
